In this project we aimed to make a tracking website for the new Dota Pro Circuit. Dota Pro Circuit is the new tournament system introduced by Valve. In this system players earn points (which we call DPC points) in tournaments and the invited teams for The International 2018 which is the biggest tournament of the year are decided by these points. Team's points are calculated from the top three players that plays in the team at that time.

In the project we store the data about players, teams and tournaments and connect them to see information about points, rosters, results, matches etc.
